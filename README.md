### Hey there, you found me.




I'm ~~a hero trapped in earth 1218~~ trying to find a balance between learning and coding games.

- 🔭 Research-wise, I'm interested in machine learning (improving continuity, generalizability, efficiency, etc.) and computer vision (vision-language and video models)
- 🚀 I'm learning to be the best software engineer I can be
- 🧐 I'm also learning Dotnet and C# for my research
- 👾 I'm currently interested in become a Game Developer
- 🌭 My dream: `while(playvideogame){money++;}`
